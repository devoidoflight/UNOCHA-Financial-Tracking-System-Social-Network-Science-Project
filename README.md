# Robustness in International Humanitarian Aid Networks

## Overview

International humanitarian aid is a complex and contested field, often hindered by limited data availability, opaque donor motives, and inconsistent reporting. Despite these challenges, it offers valuable insights into global state relations and patterns of dependency.

This project investigates the **robustness** of international humanitarian aid networks by modeling them as evolving systems of transactions. By analyzing these networks over time, we aim to better understand how they are structured and how resilient they are to disruptions.

## Research Question

**How can we conceptualize and operationalize the robustness of international humanitarian aid networks?**

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Financial Tracking Service (FTS)](https://fts.unocha.org/) by UNOCHA. It includes humanitarian aid transaction data from **1999 to 2024**.

## Methodology

### Data Partitioning

The dataset was divided by year, covering the period between **1999 and 2024**.

### Network Construction

- Yearly **bipartite networks** were created to represent donor-recipient relationships.
- **Sankey diagrams** were used to visualize aid flows over time.

### Network Analysis

- **Local clustering coefficients**
- **Degree distributions and edge weights**
- **PageRank scores**

These analyses were used to evaluate the **robustness** of the international humanitarian aid network system across different years.
